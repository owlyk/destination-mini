# Validate Input Functionality

This endpoint is used to validate user input before processing it further in the system. It ensures that the input meets the required criteria and format.

## How to Use

To interact with the validateInput functionality, make a POST request to the following endpoint:

```
POST /validateInput
```

The request body should include the input data that needs to be validated. The endpoint will return a response indicating whether the input is valid or not.

Example request body:

```
{
  "input": "example data"
}
```

Example response:

```
{
  "valid": true
}
```
